  2.1 OPERATION DESCRIPTION

      Address lines A17-A23 are connected to the processor address bus and are
      used to generate the various device decodes. 

      Expansion Ram signal is externally pulled up.  The expansion ram card
      grounds this line.  This signal is used in the generation of NRAME. 

      68000 bus timing: 

      NAS (Not Address Strobe) indicates the start of a bus cycle and remains
      asserted for the duration of the cycle.  Processor addresses (A1:23),
      status FC0:2 and PRW are valid while NAS is asserted. 

      NUDS/NLDS (Not Upper/Lower Data Strobes) indicated data is valid during
      a write or enable read data to drive the data bus.  NUDS indicates valid
      data on D7:15 and NLDS indicates valid data on D0:7. 

      PRW (Processor Read/Write) indicates the direction of data buss
      transfer.  PRW =0 is a processor write. 

      NDTACK (Not Data Transfer ACKnowledge) is an open collector or tri-state
      output drives the CPU NDTACK input.  The 68000 requires NDTACK=0 to
      complete either a read or write cycle.  This signal sets up to the end
      of processor state S4.  If NDTACK=0, the cycle will complete normally. 
      If NDTACK=1, the processor will add wait states until NDTACK=0 before
      advancing to S5 and then completing the cycle.  If NDTACK is never
      asserted (=0), the processor will hang up. This circuit provides NDTACK
      generation for all internal memory accesses and is available for
      external device use (via XRDY) if desired.  If the external device
      desires to control NDTACK directly, the NOVR signal can be asserted
      which tri-states (or forces one in the case of open collector) the
      NDTACK output. 

      XRDY (eXternal ReaDY) input is used by external devices to control the
      internal NDTACK generation in the case where NDTACK is needed to cause
      processor wait states. If XRDY is not asserted by an external device,
      the internal circuit will generate an NDTACK which does not generate any
      processor wait states.  Since XRDY can only de-assert NDTACK, this
      circuit will prevent the system from hanging up in the event that
      non-existant memory locations are accessed. 

      (include Welland timing diagram #3) 

      NOVR (Not OVeRide) input directly disables the internal generation of
      NDTACK and internal device selects.  This pin allows external devices to
      map themselves in place of existing devices (such as ROM).  In this
      case, the external device must assert it's own NDTACK.  The timing of
      this circuit IS NOR RELIABLE FOR REPLACING VIDEO RAM (NRAME) OR VIDEO
      REGISTERS (NROME). 

      OVL (OVerLay) input causes ROM to be accessed at memory location 0. 
      This signal is typically driven by a port line so that ROM is mapped to
      the memory 0 at RESET time. 

      NDBR (Not Data Bus Request) input indicates that the Amiga custom chips
      are performing a video bus DMA.  The circuit delays generation of
      NDTACK, thereby delaying the CPU if it attempts to access the video bus
      address range while NDBR is asserted. 

      NBLS (Not BLitter Slowdown) output drives the custom chip blitter
      slowdown input.  When the CPU address in BANK6 area, NBLS is asserted. 

      NBGACK (Not Bus Grant ACKnowledge) input indicates that an external DMA
      devices has taken control of the processor busses. 

      NRAME (Not RAM Enable) output indicates that the CPU is accessing video
      bus RAM (this includes expansion RAM). 

      NRGAE (Not RGA Enable) output indicates that the CPU is accessing Amiga
      custom chip register space.; 

      NCDR (Not C Data Read) output enables the output buffers of the video
      bus data latch to drive the CPU data bus. 

      NCDW (Not C Data Write) output enables the video data buffers to drive
      the video data bus. 

      C4 (Clock 4) output is used to latch data on the video data bus. 

      NVPA (Not Valid Peripheral Address) output indicates that the CPU is
      accessing an 6800 type peripheral (such as the 8520) and causes the CPU
      to perform a 6800 compatible cycle. 

      NROME (Not ROM Enable) output is the chip select for the internal 2Mb
      ROM. 

      NRTCR/NRTCW (Not Real Time Clock Read/Write) outputs are the read/write
      enables used for data transfers to and from the the real time clock
      circuit . 

      Address Decoding - The address decoding generates internal memory bank
      signals. 

      Address Range		Bank
      000000-1FFFFF		BANK0
      200000-9FFFFF		BANK14 (1 through 4) 
      A00000-BFFFFF		BANK5
      C00000-DFFFFF		BANK6
      E00000-FFFFFF		BANK7
      C00000-C7FFFF		ERAM (expansion RAM, qualified by GO)
      D80000-DB0000		NNAC (non auto config for RTC)
      E00000-E7FFFF		NROM
      FB0000-FFFFFF		NROM
      000000-1FFFFF		NROM if OVR asserted

      QUAL decode qualification is true only when NAS is asserted and both
      NDTACK and NOVR are de-asserted.  Used to qualify RAM, RGA and ROM
      selection. 

      ROME is asserted when NROM is decoded and: 

      1. Bus cycle is a read (PRW=1)
      2. NAS is asserted
      3. OVR is de-asserted

      The NDTACK circuit has to generate NDTACK for all onboard devices and
      also for expansion space (to avoid system hangs). ROM, RAM and custom
      chip registers are special because it is necessary to synchronize them
      top a specific phase of the C1,C3 clocks per the following diagram:

      (1) - NTDACK is a potential system problem in the case where NOVR is
	    activited after AS- (S2) has already asserted NTDACK.  In this
	    event, NDTACK can not be guaranteed to be pulled high before S5
	    because of the pullup resistance and node capacitance.  This is
	    the case with either Toshiba gate array or 5719. 

      (2) - Many signals are not critical timings.  50ns was selected as a
	    convenient, non-critical value.
