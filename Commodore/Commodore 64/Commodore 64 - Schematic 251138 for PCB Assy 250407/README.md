# Commodore 64

As we all know, there are multiple revisions of the C64 schematics.  What I plan on doing is a "top sheet" in KiCAD, with the various revision schematics as sub sheets for this top sheet.  I will do my best to specify as much information as I can to match a schematic to a specific board, but there are so many out there that I may miss something.  Please put an issue in GitHub to let me know if I missed anything!

Most of the images and documents under the Documents folder here were found on the [Zimmers website](http://www.zimmers.net/).   Please follow the link to Zimmers for a much more comprehensive document repository for the Commodore 64!

### Note on the RF Modulator schematic:

Several components are unlabeled or have no value.  This is due to the poor quality scan of the schematic from the service manuals.  If anyone can fill in  the blanks, please open an issue and let me know!
