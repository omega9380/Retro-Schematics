# Commodore 64

As we all know, there are multiple revisions of the C64 schematics.  My original plan was a top sheet, with the various versions of the schematic as sub-sheets, utilizing KiCAD's hierarchal sheet managament.  I quickly realized that this would really work, and it would make the C64 section of the repo HUGE once I was done.  I have since decided to seperate each version into its own project, based on the C64 Board Identification table on Page 17 of the Mar 1992 Service Manual (314001-03).

I will do my best to specify as much information as I can to match a schematic to a specific board, but there are so many out there that I may miss something.  Please put an issue in GitHub to let me know if I missed anything!

Most of the images and documents under the Documents folder here were found on the [Zimmers website](http://www.zimmers.net/), or on [MyOldComputer.nl](https://myoldcomputer.nl).   Please follow the links to these sites for a much more comprehensive document repository for the Commodore 64!

## Note on the RF Modulator schematic:

Several components are unlabeled or have no value.  This is due to the poor quality scan of the schematic from the service manuals.  If anyone can fill in  the blanks, please open an issue and let me know!
