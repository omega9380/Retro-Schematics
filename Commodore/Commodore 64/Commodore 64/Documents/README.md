# Commodore 64

As we all know, there are multiple revisions of the C64 schematics.  What I plan on doing is a "top sheet" in KiCAD, with the various revision schematics as sub sheets for this top sheet.  I will do my best to specify as much information as I can to match a schematic to a specific board, but there are so many out there that I may miss something.  Please put an issue in GitHub to let me know if I missed anything!

Most of the images and documents here were found on the [Zimmers website](http://www.zimmers.net/).  I have saved them to this Documents folder while I work on the schematic for the C64, but I will remove them when the schematic is complete.  Please follow the link to Zimmers to get these files in the future!
